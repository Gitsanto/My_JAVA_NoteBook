Assume that you hace an object and you wnat to assign
a key to it to make searching easy. To store the key/value
 pair, you can use a simple array like a data structure 
 where keys (integers) can be used directly as an index
 to store values, However, in cases where the keys are large and
 cannot be used directly as an index, you should use hashing.

 In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions.
 The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table.
